# MIFS Algorithm with Neural Network Demonstration

This Jupyter notebook implements the Mutual Information Feature Selection (MIFS) algorithm and demonstrates its application using a neural network. The project is based on the work of Battiti (1994) and uses the Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset for demonstration.

## Contents

1. MIFS Algorithm Implementation
   - Calculation of Mutual Information
   - Feature Selection Process

2. Neural Network Demonstration
   - Implementation of a simple Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
   - Training and evaluation of the ANN using selected features

3. Hyperparameter Optimization
   - Adjusting iterations and learning rate
   - Visualizing loss and accuracy improvements

## Key Features

- Implementation of MIFS algorithm for feature selection
- Demonstration of feature selection impact on a neural network
- Visualization of training loss and accuracy
- Hyperparameter tuning for improved performance

## Dataset

The project uses the Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset, available from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

## Usage

1. Ensure all required libraries are installed.
2. Run the notebook cells in order to see the MIFS algorithm in action and its application to the neural network.
